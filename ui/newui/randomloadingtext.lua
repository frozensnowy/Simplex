RandomLoadingText[1]="Select an enemy ship, click the <c=FFD800>Movie Mode</c> button and then press ESC, you will be able to control the enemy ship! This hack works on allied ships as well!"
RandomLoadingText[2]="Ships recovered from <c=FFD800>Crates</c> have random stats in every attribute. No two ships are ever identical! But wait... Why is there any ship in that box in the first place?"
RandomLoadingText[3]="<c=0095d9>Hulks</c> are spawned when capital ships are destroyed. They will be automatically cleaned when there are too many of them."
RandomLoadingText[4]="The AI in Simplex knows how to use <c=0095d9>Hyperspace Gates</c>! Always check your surroundings when playing against Vaygr CPU Experts! They are called Experts for a reason!"
RandomLoadingText[5]="If you want to try some really weird stuff, there is a <c=FFD800>Territory</c> game mode in the skirmish menu..."
RandomLoadingText[6]="Vaygr <c=0095d9>bioships</c> are the direct product of a long history of genetic engineering. Despite their fishy looking, they are technically bioweapons in the space age! Fish and ships -- that's what they are saying... Right???"
RandomLoadingText[7]="Lost your only <c=0095d9>Needleship</c> and want to have it back again? If you are playing Kadeshi and have reached the <c=FFD800>Fleet Admiral</c> rank, any capital ship or <c=0095d9>Podship</c> will have the <c=8CF96C>Reincarnation</c> option in the build menu to revive your <c=0095d9>Needleship</c>! However, the ship reincarnating into the <c=0095d9>Needleship</c> will be sacrificed in the process."
RandomLoadingText[8]="Because Progenitor ships were produced across such a vast span of time, not all of them have been equipped with phase shield. So pick the weak ones first when you have to fight them!"
RandomLoadingText[9]="What do <c=0095d9>SM Queen</c>, <c=0095d9>Big Daddy</c> and <c=0095d9>Jack Sparrow</c> all have in common? They share not only a dark painting theme on the outside, but also a special hyperspace drive ripped off the Progenitor on the inside! This means they can instantly jump into and out of hyperspace just like Progenitor ships! Exploit the superb hyperspace capability of these ships and you will have the greatest tactical advantage as a space pirate!"
RandomLoadingText[10]="If you are born to be a turtle and you crave for the absolute protection from all attack, Hiigaran <c=8CF96C>Mass Shield</c> (built on <c=0095d9>Strategic Shipyards</c>) and Kadeshi <c=FF2B6A>Dark Realm</c> (enabled on <c=0095d9>Archangels</c>) are designed just for you!"
RandomLoadingText[11]="Unlike other races, the conventional engines of Progenitor ships are powered by artificial black holes. That's why they always shine like little suns when moving and blow up in a spectacular fireball when destroyed!"
RandomLoadingText[12]="Do you know many maps in the atmosphere have <c=FFD800>Air Combat</c> features? Just capture one <c=0095d9>Aircraft Carrier</c> and military aircrafts will be produced automatically. The technological level and production efficiency of those aircrafts will depend on your upgrades in the research menu."
RandomLoadingText[13]="<c=0095d9>Sheltered Asteroids</c> are neutral asteroids implanted with shield generating device and can be found in some maps. They serve as temporary rescue shelters for star citizens in the conflict zone. You can hide there like a coward too, or you can fight like a man..."
RandomLoadingText[14]="The Hiigaran and Vaygr AI hyperspace behaviour isn't what it seems! AI players playing other races in simplex use a specialized algorithm for hyperspace strategy, and their behaviour will blow your mind! In the skirmish settings, set <c=FFD800>AI Augmented Skills</c> and <c=FFD800>Hyperspace Accessibility</c> to max, then try to fight some CPU Experts! Always bitching about stupid AI? Now it's time to see the AI jump in from all directions and slap you like a little bitch!"
RandomLoadingText[15]="OMG! Are the AI players in this game cheating? Of course not. Only your wife is."
RandomLoadingText[16]="WTF! This game SUX! Rebalance is a joke! I get REKT every time before I can build a fighter!!!! How can I get GUD at everything??? Well... Select everything and press <c=FFD800>CTRL+SHIT+S</c>, then watch your computer play with itself!"
RandomLoadingText[17]="Turanic Raiders don't cheat, they hack. See for yourself how their <c=8CF96C>Aimbot</c> (built on the <c=0095d9>Black Market</c>) one shot every tiny little fighter from 40km away with that ridiculously brutal cannon shell..."
RandomLoadingText[18]="Every capital ship of Turanic Raiders can activate a variety of <c=FFD800>Special Abilities</c> from the build menu. Each special ability will give the ship a real tactical advantage and allow it to live longer. The more experience a ship has, the more abilities it can use. Unlocked abilities can also be upgraded in the research menu."
RandomLoadingText[19]="The <c=0095d9>Black Market</c> is the Elysium of gambling, and Turanic Raiders are born gamblers. You can gamble with almost anything you've got, no matter whether it's <c=FFD800>RUs</c>, <c=FFD800>energy</c>, <c=FFD800>experience</c>, or even <c=FFD800>Honour Points</c>! Just remember, the winner takes all, and you're more than welcomed as a loser..."
RandomLoadingText[20]="If <c=FFD800>Incentive System</c> (in skirmish settings) is turned on and you have added -luatrace to your shortcut's target line, Frz.log in your Bin\\Release folder can actually log all the <c=FFD800>accolade stats</c> upon the death of each player."
RandomLoadingText[21]="A hangar full of <c=0095d9>Patchers</c> is the most effective damage control measure for the Hiigaran fleet. These fully automatic repair bots will relentlessly repair both your own and allied ships. And they are fast!"
RandomLoadingText[22]="In some maps, You may find mysteriously black objects that appear to have immeasurable sucking capabilities. Those are black holes, and they are there not just for aesthetic reasons -- they are there to suck! Do not tempt the black hole with the rear end of your ships... Just don't..."
RandomLoadingText[23]="Kadeshi has three branches of beliefs: <c=FF2B6A>Garden</c>, <c=FF2B6A>Kadesh</c>, and <c=FF2B6A>Sajuuk</c>. Each branch has three tiers of research, and you can't have them all. Choose them carefully in your research menu, because your belief will determine what items you can unlock and how you will fight the entire battle."
RandomLoadingText[24]="The Progenitor fleet command has two operating systems (runtimes): the <c=FF2B6A>Exterminator</c> and the <c=FF2B6A>Pacifier</c>. Each runtime will give the fleet a specific warfare strategy, and you can choose only one runtime in the research menu."
RandomLoadingText[25]="Besides <c=FFD800>Military Ranks</c>, the Turanic Raiders also have a pirate ranking system of their own. You need to reach the highest <c=FF2B6A>pirate rank</c> in the research menu in order to unleash the full potential of an unscrupulous space pirate!"
RandomLoadingText[26]="In <c=FFD800>Campaign</c> mode, only your <c=FFD800>Military Rank</c> is inherited from level to level, not your <c=FFD800>Honour Points</c>. So be sure to reach the highest <c=FFD800>Military Rank</c> possible at the end of every mission, and don't lose your <c=0095d9>Crew Station</c> (or you will fail spectacularly in the next level)!"
RandomLoadingText[27]="After going through many treacherous wars in the past, the Hiigaran fleet has devised a unique battle formation to survive against the most incredible odds: the <c=8CF96C>Strategic Formation</c>. When you have reached the <c=FFD800>Fleet Admiral</c> rank, you can dock your <c=0095d9>Mothership</c>, <c=0095d9>Crew Station</c>, <c=0095d9>Research Station</c>, <c=0095d9>Power Station</c> and <c=0095d9>Arsenal Ship</c> all to your <c=0095d9>Strategic Shipyard</c> to form the Strategic Formation. In this formation, major hull upgrades can be done to the <c=0095d9>Mothership</c>, and the <c=0095d9>Strategic Shipyard</c> itself will become both a formidable combat vessel (with weapon installations) and an almost indestructible line of defense (with <c=8CF96C>Mass Shield</c>)."
RandomLoadingText[28]="When you have allies, you can <c=FFD800>trade</c> with them to gain extra <c=FFD800>RUs</c> by building trade vessels. Each trade vessel will automatically find both your own and your allies' production capital ships, and then a trading network will be formed to connect all these ships. The more RUs and trade vessels you have, the more the profit!"
RandomLoadingText[29]="When there is a sun in the map, you can find your ships losing health for no apparent reason... Well, there is a reason and you are just too dumb to see! The damage comes from both the solar radiation itself and the high-energy interstellar particles. Research the <c=FF2B6A>solar shield</c> and <c=FF2B6A>remote space shield</c> upgrades in your research menu to protect your ships from the deadly dose of radiation! Planets and some ships like the <c=0095d9>Orbital Station</c> and the <c=0095d9>Black Market</c> also have their own anti-radiation field that can constantly protect your ships within a certain radius. "
RandomLoadingText[30]="As its name suggests, <c=0095d9>the Mother of All Ships</c> can give birth to a complete Vaygr fleet because she can build the Vaygr <c=0095d9>Flagship</c>. The Vaygr own one of the three hyperspace cores forged by the Progenitor only because they have acquired <c=0095d9>the Mother of All Ships</c>, which shares mysterious similarity in ship design with the Bentusi and has unknown relationship with the Progenitor."
RandomLoadingText[31]="The <c=0095d9>Shuttle</c> was originally designed as part of a public transportation system for the Hiigarans to commute between low Hiigara orbit and other workplaces in the Hiigaran system. But later on, as war approached Hiigara again, more and more functions have been added to the <c=0095d9>Shuttle</c>... It is a hangar for <c=0095d9>Patchers</c>, a defense platform to shoot down missiles, a shield generator to deflect enemy fire, a minelayer to deploy mines, a launcher to fire nukes, a carrier to transfer <c=0095d9>Sentinels</c> around the battlefield, and you can even carry four <c=0095d9>MOABs</c> with it to accomplish some kind of crazy kamikaze mission! Which genius could have invented all that..."
RandomLoadingText[32]="Why do the Hiigarans have a suicide bomber (the <c=0095d9>MOAB</c>) in their fleet? Well, desperate measures for desperate times, and the Hiigarans did become that desperate in the war against Vaygr invasion. Only the relieving twist here is, the crew of every <c=0095d9>MOAB</c> are all hand-picked from the Flat Hiigara Society!"
RandomLoadingText[33]="The <c=8CF96C>Heavy Ion Cannon</c> was originally installed on the Hiigaran <c=0095d9>Mothership</c> only as a defensive weapon, but test results revealed that this monster can burn big holes on heavy armour even from a very long distance away and can penetrate deeply into them. So Karan S'jet decided to turn this big gun into a strategic weapon and ordered the upgrade of its size again and again. The bigger the gun, the deeper the hole. That's what she said... Right???"
RandomLoadingText[34]="Have you noticed there are different colours used in this help tip sometimes? <c=0095d9>Light blue</c> indicates ship names, <c=8CF96C>grass green</c> stands for subsystems, <c=FF2B6A>crimson</c> means upgrade items, and <c=FFD800>yellow</c> represents core game elements."
RandomLoadingText[35]="The <c=8CF96C>NNP Project</c> will most likely kick your ass. Don't complain to me about a sore ass, again."
RandomLoadingText[36]="If you are using integrated graphics, Mac OS, or integrated graphics with Mac OS, chances are you may never be able to see this help tip (or the game main menu)."

RandomLoadingText[38]="Everybody dealing with real space business knows you should never trust a space merchant more than you trust a space pirate. When the Bentusi first told you that the <c=0095d9>Dreadnaught</c> is the most powerful weapon, you knew they were hiding something better from you (and they probably gave it to the Vaygr)..."
RandomLoadingText[39]="The Progenitor ships were originally all painted gold, but as aeons passed, atoms decayed and a lot of them faded into a dull green colour. Only the ships that have been recently reactivated have been restored to their full glory."
RandomLoadingText[40]="The <c=0095d9>Light Granule</c> was once a weapon used by the Progenitor to wipe out an entire civilization. An object made of neutronium was accelerated to near the speed of light and shot towards the target star. From distance, it just looked like a tiny speck of light travelling at the speed of light, hence the name <c=0095d9>Light Granule</c>. Upon impact, it would turn the target star into an exploding supernova, destroying both the star and all life around it. Every Progenitor capital ship awakened recently still possesses this awesome power of destruction."
RandomLoadingText[41]="Each Progenitor capital ship has enough power to create a miniature black hole just using the energy of light (<c=8CF96C>Kugelblitz</c>). With such advanced technology, how could the Progenitor, which was already a Type III (galaxy level) civilization, ever come to an end? Theorists have conjectured the existence of a Type IV (universe level) civilization that could alter physical laws and turn them into a weapon of any scale -- maybe the Progenitor's era was put to an end by a greater civilization like this? It's all highly speculative... "
RandomLoadingText[42]="When technology is too advanced to comprehend, it becomes magic. Every Progenitor capital can use a range of <c=8CF96C>Special Powers</c> that just look like magic. The higher the <c=FFD800>Military Rank</c>. the more the magical power."
RandomLoadingText[43]="The Hiigaran <c=0095d9>Battle Fortress</c> is a well-known knockoff of the Vaygr <c=0095d9>Command Fortress</c>. In case of being accused of plagiarism, the Hiigarans also added some knock-off Progenitor <c=0095d9>Drones</c> to it..."
RandomLoadingText[44]="Unlike the standard Hiigaran <c=0095d9>Marine Frigate</c>, Captain Soban's frigate does not require an upgrade to equip the <c=FF2B6A>Energy Cannon</c> -- he has already customized it for his own ship because he said he wanted to shoot like a real badass! Indeed, his ship packs more punch than your average upgraded <c=0095d9>Marine Frigate</c>!"
RandomLoadingText[45]="As the master of blitz tactics, the Vaygr have perfected their <c=0095d9>Attack Bombers</c> by giving them 360-degree free rotating plasma bomb launchers. The Hiigarans tried to copy their success by installing similar turrets on their own bombers, but it seems to have failed because their turrets can't rotate as fast as the Vaygr's..."
RandomLoadingText[46]="This game has a <c=FFD800>built-in trainer</c>. Just find it and you can play like a pro."
RandomLoadingText[47]="Captured <c=FFD800>Megaliths</c> are never safe, as jealous AI players will always try to take them away from you."
RandomLoadingText[48]="In <c=FFD800>Skirmish</c> mode, ships out of the map's bound will be destroyed. You can use this to your advantage by pushing or sucking your enemies out of bound."
RandomLoadingText[49]="There is a <c=FFD800>built-in music player</c> in simplex. You can use it to select your music from the playlist, change play mode, or simply find the name of the current soundtrack."
RandomLoadingText[50]="If you are constantly worried about how much time you have left for doing your homework, there is a <c=FFD800>built-in clock</c> in the event menu just to make sure you feel guilty about yourself! It displays time, date, as well as what year it is (in case you forget)!"
RandomLoadingText[51]="Every single help tip you have seen or will see in your life has already existed in the Library of Babel (<c=CF1400>https://libraryofbabel.info/</c>), including this one."
RandomLoadingText[52]="The original Progenitor <c=0095d9>Dreadnaught</c> can be charged with two <c=0095d9>Power Generators</c> to boost up the weapon performance. Just like the Progenitor, the Vaygr <c=0095d9>Dreadnaught</c> knockoffs also have to reply on an external <c=8CF96C>Power Module</c>. This is their common weakness in combat. By comparison, the Hiigaran <c=0095d9>Dreadnaught</c> has eliminated this weakness thanks to the Bentusi modification."
RandomLoadingText[53]="The Progenitor has an insatiable appetite for <c=FFD800>energy</c>. Unlike other races that heavily rely on converting matter into energy, Progenitor <c=0095d9>Power Generators</c> can also convert <c=FFD800>energy</c> into <c=FFD800>RUs</c>, which will then be used in manufacturing."
RandomLoadingText[54]="<c=0095d9>Derelict Battleships</c> are the reminder of past star wars in the galaxy and can still be found in some maps today. Capture them to gain a regional firepower advantage in the skirmish. Upgrade them in the research menu to restore their full artillery bombardment capability."
RandomLoadingText[55]="Turanic Raiders don't deploy mines because they are too lazy to do so. Instead, they use <c=0095d9>Booby Traps</c> as a simpler means to hinder the enemy advancement. Better than stationary minefields, the <c=0095d9>Booby Trap</c> can also be used as an offensive weapon to blow up the enemy base if you have drunken pirates willing to pilot it. As a side note though, unlike traps, these aren't gay."
RandomLoadingText[56]="Although the Kadeshi lived in the Garden for a long time, this doesn't mean their ships lack adaptability. Each Kadeshi capital ship can be equipped and re-equipped with two <c=8CF96C>Ascension Perks</c> to adapt to the constantly changing situation on the battlefield. Most perks only affect the carrier ship alone, but a few perks can affect nearby friendly or enemy ships as well. Keep every ship in your fleet equipped with a smart combination of <c=8CF96C>Ascension Perks</c> at any moment, and your chance of victory will multiply!"
RandomLoadingText[57]="Are you wondering how to unplug the <c=0095d9>Power Generators</c> after you have docked them to the <c=0095d9>Reaver</c> or the <c=0095d9>Dreadnaught</c>? Well, there's literally an <c=8CF96C>unplug</c> option in the build menu! It should be just as easy to <c=8CF96C>unplug</c> as it is to plug in... Is that what she said?"
RandomLoadingText[58]="<c=0095d9>Shifters</c> and <c=0095d9>Agitators</c> can dock with each other or themselves to form a <c=0095d9>Combo</c>, which has more armour and firepower but less harassment coverage than the individuals. Once combined, they will be stuck together and cannot be separated again. The <c=0095d9>Combos</c> can also be built directly after finishing relevant research."
RandomLoadingText[59]="Fighters and corvettes also have <c=FFD800>experience</c> like other bigger ships, but the benefit of their <c=FFD800>experience</c> is mostly limited to health regeneration and speed boost. The only exception is the Progenitor -- their fighters and corvettes will gain experience and become stronger in every aspect just like frigates and capital ships."
RandomLoadingText[60]="With higher <c=FFD800>experience</c>, capture frigates (such as <c=0095d9>Marine Frigates</c> and <c=0095d9>Infiltrator Frigates</c>) can capture enemy ships at a faster rate. For the ships being captured, higher <c=FFD800>experience</c> will also make them more resistant against enemy boarding (because they know the drill)."
RandomLoadingText[61]="Progenitor drones are usually not built with full health because it takes forever to mold all their shape-memory alloys into the absolutely perfect form. Therefore, they are often launched once the manufacturing AI thinks it's already close enough to optimal. However, if you let the newly built drones stay docked in the hanger, they can continue to be fine-tuned there and gradually increase their health to an insane level before launch!"
RandomLoadingText[62]="You can use the <c=FFD800>Class Selector</c> to select ships by class. It also doubles as a player selector to allow you to view <c=FFD800>accolade stats</c> other than your own."
RandomLoadingText[63]="The Turanic Raiders are often too lazy to do the dirty work themselves, so they use their dirty money to hire some <c=0095d9>mercenaries</c> instead. The <c=0095d9>mercenaries</c> are professional militant groups from all over the galaxy and will work for whoever pays the most. Many of them have quite good equipment as well, because money, money can buy everything..."
RandomLoadingText[64]="Have you ever wondered why the artillery shells fired by the <c=8CF96C>Fusion Mortar</c> and the <c=0095d9>SM Queen</c> always explode in a big green boom? Those are chemical weapons containing chlorine trifluoride that can react violently upon contact with any ship hull -- that's why they can deal so much area damage even in the vacuum of space!"
RandomLoadingText[65]="Both Hiigaran and Vaygr frequently use nuclear weapons in battle, because the radiation produced by nuclear explosion is extremely effective against many subsystems. While the Hiigarans prefer delivering nukes in missile launchers of various sizes, the Vaygr seem to have been obsessed with <c=8CF96C>Nuke Cannons</c>."
RandomLoadingText[66]="No matter what type of warhead the <c=0095d9>SCUD Launcher</c> is equipped with, a volley attack always tends to blow up everything into a million pieces, making it a real pain the ass for the Turanic Raiders to collect their trophies after every battle..."
RandomLoadingText[67]="Not all nebulae you see are natural -- some are artificially created by Kadeshi ships. After some upgrades in the research menu, the Kadeshi <c=FF2B6A>nebula</c> can hurt you even more than the radiation from a real nebula!"
RandomLoadingText[68]="The <c=0095d9>Battle Ark</c> was designed with a purpose to hold an entire Hiigaran armada inside, do a quick hyperspace jump, and then dump everything in the enemy's backyard. But in reality, this battle plan doesn't often work out as planned because you see, a simple gravity well could just ruin the fun... So, most commanders really don't ever bother stuffing ships into this gigantic monster -- they just use it as a creativity wall instead."
RandomLoadingText[69]="Traps are gay, no matter what they tell you. Why I think that's the case? The Turanic Raiders told me of course. And they never lie... Right?"
RandomLoadingText[70]="Despite its name, the laser cannon of Vaygr doesn't actually shoot laser; the lance cannon does. Nobody knows what is coming out of the laser cannon -- even the Vaygr themselves don't know..."
RandomLoadingText[71]="<c=8CF96C>Deep Space Sensor</c> can not only detect traces of hyperspace jump, but also enemies beyond your fleet's conventional sensor range. Upgrade it in the research menu to reveal more enemies across the map."
RandomLoadingText[72]="If the Internet is already a shitty place, just imagine the scale of the shitstorm when everybody's brain is directly connected! That's why the Bentusi decided to kill themselves... No?"
RandomLoadingText[73]="When the <c=0095d9>Reaver</c> or the <c=0095d9>Harbinger</c> is docked with two <c=0095d9>Power Generators</c>, the firepower of their phase cannon will scale up by an exact factor of 4.285714285714285714285714285714..."
RandomLoadingText[74]="The Progenitor <c=0095d9>Sleeper</c> got its name not because it has slept for a long time, but because it can literally put things to sleep with its <c=FF2B6A>Lockdown</c> ability!"
RandomLoadingText[75]="The Kadeshi <c=0095d9>Swarmers</c> are not unmanned drones, but they use them as if they are unmanned drones anyway..."
RandomLoadingText[76]="The Hiigaran fleet completely depends on <c=0095d9>Crew Cells</c> to recruit all personnel. If you have lost all your Crew Cells, your fleet won't be able to replenish the lost combat crew and will face a workforce crisis. Unlike the Hiigarans, other races can always fill their crew capacity almost instantly because of little birth control and overpopulation."
RandomLoadingText[77]="As crazy as it might sound, the <c=0095d9>Troll Destroyer</c> is indeed a destroyer made by the troll! After bundling six scrapped Vaygr <c=0095d9>Destroyers</c> together into one, the trolling businessman at the junkyard successfully pushed this pile of bullshit into the battlecruiser class! And of course he made himself a good fortune out of this crap..."
RandomLoadingText[78]="How do you keep millions of unscrupulous drunken bastards organized under a central fleet command (or gang)? The answer is democracy! A <c=8CF96C>President</c> with absolute power is elected on the <c=0095d9>Pirate Ship</c> and shall never be changed! Sounds pretty democratic... No?"
RandomLoadingText[79]="Regardless of the wild rumours flying around, the Hiigaran <c=0095d9>Power Station</c> is not burning dead bodies to generate <c=FFD800>energy</c>. The same could be less clear to tell for the Turanic Raiders' <c=0095d9>Power Plant</c> though..."
RandomLoadingText[80]="If you find the frigates and capital ships in simplex are fast, that's because they are. If you can't play with ships that are fast, that's because you suck. When you suck, feel free to set the <c=FFD800>Unit Behaviour</c> to Turtle in your skirmish settings. And BTW, most pros play this game with 20X speed hack."
RandomLoadingText[81]="How many hotkeys do you know to use? Yes, there are hotkeys for this game besides the screenshot button! If you didn't even know there was a screenshot button, simply press the power button on your computer. What? You don't know where your power button is?"
RandomLoadingText[82]="Hiigaran <c=0095d9>Mechgun Corvettes</c> and <c=0095d9>Patrol Frigates</c> look old because they are recycled antique ships that had some outstanding battle records in the past. They are fitted with the latest technology and reenlisted in the fleet to boost the newbies' morale."
RandomLoadingText[83]="Area multipliers (provided by both special subsystems and some ships) will multiply on top of each other when two of the same kind overlap. For example, if one <c=8CF96C>Fire Control Tower</c> has an area multiplier of 1.2X affecting all nearby ships' firepower, then two of such subsystems overlapping together will boost the affected ships' firepower to 1.44X, and so on."
RandomLoadingText[84]="The Hiigaran <c=0095d9>Destroyer</c> is a reverse-engineered product of the Vaygr counterpart. They don't look too much alike on the outside because the Hiigarans made their knockoffs better than the original (or at least as they claim). The Hiigarans produced several <c=0095d9>destroyer</c> variants based on the same chassis, each with a different weapon system installed to satisfy a specific combat need. They also left a place on each variant's hull to install an <c=FF2B6A>ECM Emitter</c>, which can greatly improve their destroyers' survivability in a battle group."
RandomLoadingText[85]="Nothing will make the Kadeshi happier than watching their enemies burn, and they want to watch them burn in hell! Driven by their very religious obsession with fire, the Kadeshi inevitably invented the <c=0095d9>Multiflame Frigate</c>, which finally made sure all the heretics would burn in hell."
RandomLoadingText[86]="The <c=8CF96C>Assembly Bay</c> on <c=0095d9>Lord</c> and <c=0095d9>Big Daddy</c> are said to be able to speed up production automatically, but the Turanic Raiders never tried to figure out how it works. They were just told by the company who sold them this thing that they should never worry about how it works. The company's name is Fudgicon."
RandomLoadingText[87]="Researchers have shown being addicted to old video games or games in old game engines are a sign of autism. Being addicted to old video games you suck at is a sign of brain damage."
RandomLoadingText[88]="If you like a particular soundtrack in this game so much that you want to have a copy, don't bother trying to convert the fda file into mp3, because chances are you are too stupid to do that. Simply record a video in game and extract the audio from there!"
RandomLoadingText[89]="Like this game but don't like playing this game? No problem! Scout around in the <c=FFD800>Data Folder</c> and open up some files. You can start making your very own mod based on it!"
RandomLoadingText[90]="The Vaygr <c=8CF96C>Concussion Cannon</c> is not very accurate, but it will give you concussion when it hits because the canisters it fires are essentially mini nukes! A tiny amount of nuclear material just below the critical mass is stuffed into each container, and it is guaranteed to go kaboom when jiggled!"
RandomLoadingText[91]="Why is there Tiberium in the asteroids? Shhh... This is the biggest conspiracy of all time! Our collectors must keep it a secret so that nobody on the ground will know Tiberium is alive and will soon devour the entire universe..."
RandomLoadingText[92]="Have a massive fleet in campaign but don't want to wait for every ship to launch in the beginning of the mission? No problem! Simply put your ships into a formation, and they will jump in by hyperspace as a group instead of being launched one by one!"
RandomLoadingText[93]="To show off their technological prowess, the Vaygr have equipped their <c=0095d9>Mechanics</c> with three repair modes: normal mechanical repair, direct nanobot beam repair, and area beam repair. A horde of fully upgraded <c=0095d9>Mechanics</c> will basically make your fleet immortal!"
RandomLoadingText[94]="Feeling lonely and nobody is playing with you? No problem! Set the <c=FFD800>CPU Name</c> to Personal in skirmish settings, and voila! Your imaginary buddies (millions of them) will come online and play with you!"
RandomLoadingText[95]="Is there God Mode in this game? Yes! Fight against 5 Expert AI players, or better yet, NNP to see if God will save you!"
RandomLoadingText[96]="On some Hiigaran warships, the fancy little turrets (such as the <c=8CF96C>CIWS</c>) that came with them for free can be destroyed. Once they get destroyed, you won't be able to get them back because you got them for free!"
RandomLoadingText[97]="How to be good at campaign if you are a noob? First, practice using Hiigaran in skirmish until you can beat an Expert AI player. If you can't, then get a Hiigaran AI Expert as your ally and observe how it fights other Expert AI players. Secondly, play Vaygr and Progenitor in skirmish too. Learn what these races are capable of and also find their weaknesses. Thirdly, if you still suck at campaign, enable cheats!"
RandomLoadingText[98]="Feeling overwhelmed by all the ships you have to control? No problem! There's a <c=FFD800>Sole Survivor</c> game mode just for people with limited mental capacity like you! With just one single ship to control, you think you can definitely outsmart all your enemies. Right?"
RandomLoadingText[99]="Just like people from the old time said: there's power in unity! In the <c=FFD800>Sole Survivor</c> game mode, allied players will share all the upgraded ship stats acquired through <c=FFD800>Crates</c>, making it much harder for the lone wolves to win."
RandomLoadingText[100]="Got a crappy ship at the start of the <c=FFD800>Sole Survivor</c> mode? No problem! Just eat as many <c=FFD800>Crates</c> as possible to upgrade it. May the scout kill a battlecruiser one day!!!"
RandomLoadingText[101]="<c=FFD800>Crates</c> in the <c=FFD800>Sole Survivor</c> game mode behave completely different from those in the other game modes. There's no chance the <c=FFD800>Crates</c> will blow you out of the galaxy in the <c=FFD800>Sole Survivor</c> mode. Instead, they contain only more awesome stuff to upgrade your ship!"
RandomLoadingText[102]="The <c=FFD800>Sole Survivor</c> game mode has a very useful <c=FFD800>Auto Survey</c> function. Set your sole survivor to aggressive tactic and it will automatically go to the nearest crate and unbox it, saving all the work for lazy people like you!"
RandomLoadingText[103]="The <c=FFD800>Pilot Mode</c> offers you a unique combat experience from the first-person view. When activated, you can control any ship that can move to fly towards the direction your camera is pointing at. Use zoom to control the ship's speed (closer zoom will reduce the speed)."
RandomLoadingText[104]="There're two modes for the <c=FFD800>Pilot Mode</c>: Aggressive and Non-Aggressive, depending on the tactic you are using. Non-Aggressive mode is for drive only; Aggressive mode will activate the ship's weapon system and let it shoot at the target in the front of it."
RandomLoadingText[105]="While the Hiigaran <c=8CF96C>Rapid Sweepers</c> and <c=8CF96C>Heavy Flak Cannons</c> can deal great damage to enemy fighters, corvettes and even frigates, they are also notoriously known for their record-breaking friendly kills. This is why for any commander with a mixed battle group, <c=8CF96C>Fast Plasma Cannons</c> are always considered a superior option when available -- they can only engage fighters and corvettes, but at least they do it right! That is, you do not need to worry about wiping out your own fighters or missiles when aiming at your enemies..."
RandomLoadingText[106]="Turanic Raiders like to collect <c=8CF96C>Trophies</c> not just from their enemies, but also from their allies (stealing). Put the latest and shiniest <c=8CF96C>Trophies</c> on your <c=0095d9>Lord</c> or <c=0095d9>Big Daddy</c> to earn mad respect from all other drunken bastards!"
RandomLoadingText[107]="When mature, the Kadeshi belief in the <c=FF2B6A>Garden</c> enables the <c=0095d9>Needleships</c> to forge an impenetrable barrier with the pure power of will. The primordial form of this barrier is the <c=8CF96C>AT Field</c>, or absolute terror field, which blocks all incoming fire at the front of the ship. A higher form of this shield is the <c=0095d9>Iron Curtain</c>, which completely surrounds the ship and isolates it from all weapon fire -- not even its own weapons can pass through."
RandomLoadingText[108]="You've probably seen a million cool-as-fuck space warship designs already, but 99.99% of them are total rubbish. A practical space combat vessel demands not only firepower and defense, but also agility and stealth, just like the history of all weapons since the beginning of war. Dayuuuum! That explains why the ships are all so damn fast in this game!"
RandomLoadingText[109]="Oftentimes a simple solution can perform as good as a complex one. Unlike Hiigaran destroyers that are fitted with <c=FF2B6A>Onboard ECM</c>, the Vaygr destroyer-class vessels simply equip themselves with <c=FF2B6A>Smoke Screen</c> that can interfere with sensors like ECM when upgraded. Similarly, the Turanic Raiders are able to launch <c=8CF96C>Smoke Grenades</c> from almost all capital ships to confuse their enemy."
RandomLoadingText[110]="The Hiigaran <c=0095d9>Missile Destroyer</c> and <c=0095d9>Sweeper Destroyer</c> are antagonistic, meaning they don't like each other. When shooting at the same target, shrapnel coming from the flak burst will destroy all the nearby missiles, rendering the combined firepower ineffective. This is because these two ships are designed to engage different targets and a qualified Hiigaran commander should know how to get the most out of each of them."
RandomLoadingText[111]="As a major upgrade, the Hiigaran <c=8CF96C>Mothership Battle Asset</c> is very expensive to build from the <c=0095d9>Mothership</c>. However, it can be purchased at a much lower cost from the <c=0095d9>Strategic Shipyard</c> with <c=8CF96C>Strategic Formation</c>."
RandomLoadingText[112]="Multiple ships with research modules will speed up the research progress. For Vaygr, you can build multiple <c=8CF96C>Research Divisions</c>, and for Kadeshi, you can build multiple <c=8CF96C>Theological Seminaries</c>. You can also capture enemy ships with additional research modules to speed up your research."
RandomLoadingText[113]="<c=0095d9>Hulks</c> can be restored to the original ship if captured and repaired. You can also revive destroyed enemy ships and own them this way. Lost too many ships and have no money to build more? No problem! Step 1: Capture the shipwreck. Step 2: Repair. Step 3: PROFIT!!!"
RandomLoadingText[114]="Some ships equipped with defense field also have radiation shield. When your ships are passing through a nebula and taking damage from the radiation, you can engage defense field to protect them."
RandomLoadingText[115]="<c=0095d9>Titans</c> are some of the most fearsome war machines designed by the Vaygr engineers. Their insane firepower speaks for the maximum strength of the Vaygr fleet. Any hostile fleet happening to find itself within the range of a <c=0095d9>Titan</c> will never be whole again."
RandomLoadingText[116]="Ever noticed many Vaygr heavy missiles fly more erratically than Hiigaran torpedoes? Rumours say this is because these Vaygr missiles are pigeon-guided! It is believed that the Vaygr used highly trained pigeons pecking on a touch screen of live video feed to guide the missiles towards their targets. They developed this technology probably to cut cost, or perhaps to make the missiles harder to be intercepted -- but definitely to cut cost..."
RandomLoadingText[117]="If a game lasts long enough, random <c=FFD800>Endgame Crisis</c> could occur. The bigger the map, the later the crisis would start. Before that, just make sure you have a very strong fleet with all available upgrades, or you will die like a noob!"
RandomLoadingText[118]="The <c=FFD800>Survival</c> game mode is designed as a training ground for anyone who wants to become real pro. Waves of enemy ships will tirelessly attack and you will need to master every aspect of this game in order to survive. With the numerous adjustable hyperparameters provided, you can customize the difficulty of the game and maximize your fun. Plus, there're also tons of kabooms to watch!"
RandomLoadingText[119]="Are you a noob? Do you like turtling and using your allies as meat shield? No problem! Try out the <c=FFD800>Survival</c> game mode. This is like the best target practice you could ever imagine -- except you are the target, and you can play 5 vs 1 while still getting rekt! Enjoy!"
RandomLoadingText[120]="<c=0095d9>Neural Net Ponies</c> will most likely totally wreck you. But if you ask them nicely, there's a small chance they'll go easy on you and maybe they'll even teach you some tactics!"
RandomLoadingText[121]="In response to the long-range bombardment capability of the Hiigaran <c=0095d9>Arsenal Ship</c>, the Vaygr came up with a durable artillery platform of their own. They inventively named it -- the <c=0095d9>Tank</c>!"
