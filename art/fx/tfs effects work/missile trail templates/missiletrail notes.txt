==Primary File (style_spray)==
Emiter Rate = Amount of particles dispersed per second. Over 100 causes significant slowdown.
Emiter Duration = The amount of time in seconds the effect lasts for before turning off
Emiter LOD = Controls LOD at certain distances?

==Particle FX Slave File==
Duration = Length of particle emiter (determines how long the trail is)
	High duration uses more system resources!

=Types Notes=
Missile_Fusion_Trail (slave: Missile_Fusion_Trail_Slave): 
	For Vaygr Fusions, low emiter, long duration
Missile_Heavy_Trail (Slave: Missile_Heavy_Trail_Slave): 
	For Battleship Missiles/Torpedoes Only (for weapons with low RoF!) - long bushy trail

v1.1 missle_ignite_combo stats (default fusion missile):
	Duration = 10, Emitter Duration = 4 (10 in TFSv2.8), Emitter Rate = Up to 107

Modify Ignite Combo (reduce FX) to increase performance with Missile_Trail?

-----New Ignites---
missle_ignite_combo_short: Emitter Duration is 5
