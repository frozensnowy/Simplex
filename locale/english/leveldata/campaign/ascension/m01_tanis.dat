42000    Tanis Engineering to Mothership... Good to have you online.
42001    Communication uplink Confirmed. Beginning telemetry synchronization.
42002    Initiating telemetry data stream...
42003    Wait. Something's wrong. Power readings are well below expected parameters.
42004    Confirmed. Main Reactor barely maintaining 10% output. Most systems are dropping into emergency power mode.
42005    Attempting to reroute and compensate for power inefficiency.
42006    Compensation failed. Core power draw exceeding available capacity.
42007    Power Station's arrival is overdue. They should have been here before core transfer...
42008    Hyperspace signature detected. Power Station emergence confirmed.
42009    Power feed integration complete. Minimum acceptable power levels reached. We are ready to begin launch trials.


// intelevent_buildpowermodule
41901 Power allocation failure. Unable to proceed with combat trials.
41902 The Power Station is overloaded and is unable to maintain sufficient power for the fleet.
41903 Engineering believes it can enhance the output of the power station through the construction of Torodial Magnets.
41904 The Station will continue to take damage until power levels have stabilized. Build a Torodial Magnet on the Power Station immediately.
