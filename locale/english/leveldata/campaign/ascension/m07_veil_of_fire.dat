// IntelEvent: Clear Debris 	
//  Fleet Command
43020	Hyperspace jump interrupted.
//  Fleet Intel
43021	We are surrounded by Progenitor wreckage.
// FI Alternate line, in case the map isn't adjusted so as to actually surround the player w/ wreckage
43026	We have exited Hyperspace in close proximity to a debris field.
43022	The Oracle confirms this wreckage was once the engineering bay of the Progenitor Ship.
43023	*** AXED *** This entire region is flooded with radioactive clouds.
// FI These lines are required to clarify the reason behind destroying the debris.
43024	 Scans of the surrounding hulks have detected Quantum Wave Form irregularities. They are preventing us from initiating a Hyperspace jump.
43025	 If we are to reach the Dreadnaught, the debris must be cleared.  Send a probe to investigate the local hulks.
// This line was axed because it *didnt* explain the reasons for pursuing the mission objectives.
// *** AXED *** 43024	We must clear a path through the clouds and move the Mothership safely to this location before we can initiate a hyperspace jump.

// IntelEvent: Vaygr Probe Detected 
//  Fleet Intel
43030	Priority alert.
43031	A Vaygr long-range probe has been activated.
43032	It must be destroyed before it can relay our position to the enemy.

//  SpeechEvent: Probe Away
//  Fleet Intel
43035	The probe is transmitting data to the enemy.
43036	A Vaygr attack is now imminent.

// SpeechEvent: Probe neutralized 
//  Fleet Intel
43040	Probe destroyed.
43041	It is likely the enemy will send patrols to investigate.
43042	Prepare for possible Vaygr attacks.

// IntelEvent: Vaygr Hyperspacing in 
//  Fleet Intel
43045	Alert!
43046	Hyperspace signature detected.
43047	Elite Vaygr forces are using shielded carriers to penetrate the radiation.

// SpeechEvent: Radiation Damage 
//  Fleet Intel
43049	 Alert. We are detecting dangerous levels of radiation.
43050	*** AXED *** Our ships cannot withstand this radiation.
43051	They must be destroyed to allow the Mothership to Hyperspace.
// FI This line has been added to gel with the tweaked opening
43052	These hulks appear to be the source.
// 43052 *** AXED *** The radiation is coming from these hulks.
43053	Progenitor Movers have been located within the cloud.
43054	They appear to be able to withstand the radiation.
// FI This line is of minor concern - it's just better/more consistant than the previous one.  We had to re-record anyhow, as the line read replicate, but the voice acting read duplicate
43055	Research division has completed analysis of the derelict Mover we discovered.  We can now replicate Mover technology. 
// *** AXED *** 43055	Research division reports it can replicate Mover technology.
43056	Build a Mover Construction Facility.
// Again, line provides a little additional data
43057	Movers will be able to safely enter the radiation cloud and destroy the contaminated hulks.


// IntelEvent : Movers Under Control 
//  Fleet Command
43060	Mover Construction Facility online.
//  Fleet Intel
// Line changed a little to reflect closer ties to actual objectives.
43061	Use Movers to destroy the debris.

//  SpeechEvent: Destroy Debris
//  Fleet Intel
43065	Debris destroyed.
43066	The radiation in the area is diminishing.

//  SpeechEvent: Destroy Debris
//  Fleet Intel
43070	Radioactive hulk destroyed.

// IntelEvent: Enter the Hangar 
//  Fleet Intel
// Lines changed to reflect debris chunks, rather than radiation, is the issue.
43075	Radiation levels dropping. The Quantum Wave Form is returning to normal tolerance.  
43076	We are now clear to enter Hyperspace.

// SpeechEvent: Enter the Hangar 
//  Fleet Command
43080	Hyperspace Core fully charged.
43081	Detecting only minor Quantum Waveform fluctuations. We are clear to jump.
43082	Initiate Hyperspace. 

// NEW DIALOG
// FI
43090	We cannot be followed. Eradicate all remaining Vaygr forces.

43120	Radioactive debris.  Destroy it to reduce the Quantum irregularities in this area.

43121	Send a probe to  investigate the debris.
//ping description for 43013
43124	Destroy the probe before it can broadcast our location.

// Objective descriptions

// For 43000
43130	Build a Mover Production Subsystem on the Mothership. It is located in the Corvette Panel.
// For 43001
43131	Use Movers to destroy all seven radioactive hulks.
43135	This will reduce the Quantum Interference, allowing the Mothership to Hyperspace freely.
// For 43002
43132	Send a ship to investigate the debris producing the irregularities in this area.
