60000	UNKNOWN LOCATION - NEBULA OUTSKIRTS

// intelevent_initialization
//FC
60100   Hyperspace Jump failed. We have misjumped.
//FI
60101	The Hyperspace Core and critical systems survived the emergency jump, but we have exited far off-course in an uncharted nebula.
60102	Long-range scanners are offline and the surrounding nebula and background radiation are crippling mobility. 
60103   Fleet operations will remain at minimum capacity until we rendezvous with the crew transports at Hiigara.
// Fleet Command
60104	Unable to initiate hyperspace. The jump has drained all available power from the core.

// Fleet Intelligence
60105	The hyperspace core is critically low on power, and it will take some time to recharge. Until then, regaining situational awareness is our main priority.
60106	Deploy scout squadrons to these coordinates to establish a sensor perimeter around the mothership.
60107	Caution: The fleet is operating on emergency reserves and we have no reliable data on potential hostiles. All units remain on high alert.

// intelevent_turanicraidersspotted
//ScoutSquadron (Actor_AllShips)
60200	Command, picking up multiple contacts bearing 420. Configuration and intent unknown.
60201	Wait, they're powering weapons!
//FI
60202	All Squadrons, return to the mothership immediately. Unknown hostiles on approach vector.
60203	We must defend the mothership at all costs.

// Return control to the player now. Wait 5 seconds and play:
//Pirate Raiders1
60230	Well well well... what do we have here boys? Hiigaran Navy, lost in our little corner?
//Pirate Raiders2
60231	Look at their mothership! I bet it'll fetch a nice price on the black market!

// analysis_turanicraiders - During this the waves at wave 2, we don't remove control from the player continue for a bit longer.
//FI
60250	Analysis of enemy craft complete. Configuration matches turanic raider design patterns. This is... Unexpected. The raiders haven't been seen in Hiigaran space in decades.
//FC
60251	They're using the nebula for cover. Standard pirate hit and run tactics.

// heavy_interceptors_unlock
60555	Engineering has adapted Raider missile technology. Heavy Interceptors are now available for construction.

// Heavy Interceptor Secondary Objective
60560	Build a Heavy Interceptor Squadron
60561	Construct a Heavy Interceptor squadron to test the newly adapted missile technology against the attacking pirates.

// sensor_found_beacons
60400	Caution. We are detecting the presence of turanic raider beacons in the vicinity.
60401	If the Raiders detect our combined presence, they are bound to call in reinforcements.
60402	The carrier is transfering two spy squadrons to us. They are equiped with cloaking generators.
60403	Use the spy squadrons to destroy the raider beacons.

60473	Gamma point established. Expanding coverage.
60474	Delta sector online. Sensor perimeter complete.

// Scout Objectives
60480	Deploy Scout Perimeter
60481	Send scouts to the marked locations to establish a sensor network around the mothership.
60482	Construct four scouts by clicking on the build menu, selecting the fighters tab and clicking on the scout icon four times.

// Defend the Mothership Objective and descriptions
60483	Defend the Mothership.
60484	The Pride of Hiigara is under attack. Construct Interceptor squadrons to defend against incoming hostiles.

// HeavyInterceptorUnlocked
60555	We have reverse engineered the missile launch systems found on some of the Pirate crafts. Heavy Interceptors are now available for construction.

// Low Pilot Warning Event
60570	All available pilots have been deployed... Unable to maintain combat effectiveness.
60571	Mayday. This is the Pride of Hiigara broadcasting on all open frequencies. We are under attack and unable to fight back! I repeat, mayday, mayday!
60572	The signal is being degraded by nebula interference. Transmission range compromised.

// Pirate Raider Mocking
60573	Aww, poor Hiigara. Guess you're gonna find out what it's like to lose your homeworld after all!
60574	Yar, I call dibs on the bald chick in the core!! Bet she's got some fine Hiigaran ass!!
60575	Mmmh Hah, as if I'd let you anywhere near that booty!

// intelevent_capitalclassincoming
//FI
60300	Alert!
60301	Capital Class signature detected.
//FC
60302	It's an Hiigaran Battle Carrier!
//BattleCarrierGroup
60303	Pride of Hiigara, this is battlegroup Seelum. We were on route to Angel moon to provide escort duties to the Crew Transports. After receiving your faint distress signal, we diverted here instead. You were lucky we were passing near when you sent it.


// They send aid to us, and we wait until they reached us. The carrier remains far away but the aid is welcome. Then we play this.
//FC
60304	Can you assist us in defending against the incoming attackers? We are critically  low on crew and resources, and our hull is compromised.
//BattleCarrierGroup
60305	Affirmative, we're dispatching heavy fighters and corvettes to you now, alongside some patchers to help repair your hull. Hang in there!
60306	This is Selum to all squadrons, prepare to engage the enemy. The survival of the Homeworld depends on it!


// We stop the wave sending, and wait for all enemies to be destroyed. Then proceed.
// intelevent_establishtrade
//FI
60350	With resourcing operations limited, and the core still recharging, trading resources may be in our best interest.
60351	Build a trade convoy and establish a trade route with the Battle Carrier.
